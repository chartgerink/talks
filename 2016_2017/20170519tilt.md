# Panel: Ownership of nonpersonal data: the impact on scientific research 

Chair: Marco Caspers

Panel members: Matej Myska, Marco Caspers, Freyja van
den Boom, Radim Polák, Chris
Hartgerink, Andreas Wiebe and Lucie
Guibault

Description: The panel will discuss the issue of non-personal data
ownership and the re-use thereof in scientific research, in
particular, what we can learn from regulation of existing IP
rights when potentially introducing a new right. To what
extent can we apply the idea-expression dichotomy? What
subject matter test could or should apply? How to design
such right in order to promote current and future
technologies enabling the re-use of research data and how
to distinguish (if at all) ‘public’ research data and industrial
data.

## Data aren't property 

1. I am not a legal expert; I am a researcher.
	* hence I'll give an untalk; more of a discussion than a presentation so interrupt me whenever you'd like.
	* social sciences
	* meta-research: how researchers do research and how that affects the validity of findings
	* data sharing big issue
		* little sharing
		* much obfuscation
		* little verification
		* how valid are scientific findings? Most are probably false...
		* I think liberal data rules are necessary when it comes to non-personal data, to promote a healthy scholarly discussion about results. 
			* In recent years we've seen that we scientists can prove the impossible with data, such as [looking into the future](https://redux.slate.com/cover-stories/2017/05/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html) with the methods we now have
			* data scrutiny is necessary, requires access

2. AFAIK, property is zero-sum
  * I can give you my property
  * someone can steal it
  * but I cannot let you have it and still have it myself

3. Data technically aren't property.
  * I can give you access and still retain access myself
  * If I am the sole accessor, the data stop existing if I lose access

4. Data are uncopyrightable and public domain by definition, but access is restricted.
  * Okay, we can work with this
  * So providing public access to that public domain is the problem more so than ownership
  * Who gets to say who gets access?
    * for personal data, the access is restricted to protect individuals (makes sense)
    * for non-personal/scientific data, the access is restricted because...?
    	* From researcher's perspective (this is from research done at UvA by Bobby-Lee Houtkoop)
    		* sharing is not a common practice in the researcher’s field,
    		* researchers prefer to share their data upon request
    		* researchers consider preparing data for sharing is too time consuming
    		* researchers have never learned to share data
	* for industrial data
		* competitive edge?
		* prevents collaboration which might create even more competitive edge
		* moreover: performance feedback needs data from other companies
			* so if everyone shares performance data, everyone benefits; if nobody shares and you do you're the sucker (Prisoner's Dilemma)

5. Producer determines access 
	* aligns with idea that collections of data can be regarded as creative works under sui generis database directive (at the moment) 
	* Researcher's seemingly don't regard their data as their own creative work under sui generis
	* however, redistribution of research data is still chilled under sui generis
		* licensing isn't clearly disclosed (e.g., [https://thinklab.com/discussion/integrating-resources-with-disparate-licensing-into-an-open-network/107](https://thinklab.com/discussion/integrating-resources-with-disparate-licensing-into-an-open-network/107))
		* researchers are cautious about reusing data
		* new research findings? Secondary data not shared and legally ambiguous for researchers
  	* but the sui generis argument, that a research database wouldn't be collected if no protections are offered, seems to make no sense
  	* also no discussion about the lost value to society by restricting access to the data
  		* reanalyses
  		* linking datasets
   		* e.g. [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
  			* free knowledge base
  			* massive amounts of data (approximately 26 million already)
  			* specific databases can be created from this easily
  			* stimulates reuse for research
  			* also facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration due to 
		* costs to measure again by obfuscated access to existing data

6. so nonpersonal research data
	* nobody owns research data; facts
	* access is the problem
	* but researchers hardly approach this problem from an IP perspective, primarily conventions
