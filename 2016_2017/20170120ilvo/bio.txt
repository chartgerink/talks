Chris Hartgerink is a third year PhD-candidate at Tilburg University, where he specializes in detecting scientific bias and misconduct with statistics. But his work extends far beyond what: he is pushing ourselves to ask whether the way we do science is the way we want to be doing it and whether it is the way we ought to be doing it. He spends much time promoting good science by both promoting transparent access to data, research, and materials, but also explaining how and why this is so important. He is actively working on better copyright legislation for research and education. European Commissioner for science Carlos Moedas labeled his work on open access to knowledge as "tireless" and he has been awarded the Right to Research Coalition Next Generation Leadership award for his refreshing ideas. At 25, he has already been featured three times in Nature News and is creating waves in the scientific discussion. Today, he will share some of his ideas on ethics in the modern day of science.
