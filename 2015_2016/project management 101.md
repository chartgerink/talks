# Research project management 101
---
Managing your research is vital for successful project completion and certain files need to be centrally deposited according to university guidelines (i.e., `data package`). As a researcher, you must frequently switch between projects and mindsets, where returning to a previous (un)finished project can be difficult because of lack of documentation and project management. Thorough project management can help you to succeed in switching projects in an efficient manner, and helps understand the choices made during the research process in a retroactive manner. Moreover, project management can help prevent loss of research files, incoherent project structures, corruption of files, and prevents having multiple manuscript files (e.g., `MS_final.docx`, `MS_finalfinal.docx`, `MS_final with comments.docx`). This workshop provides a framework for structuring your research project, provides an introduction to version control for your research project, shows you how to pre-register research hypotheses, and provides good data practices for any research paper. The workshop will include active participation, where participants can directly apply the principles outlined in the workshop to structure a current or previous project.
