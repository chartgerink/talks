How to handle retrospective ethics in a prospective world.
---
Responsible conduct of research is crucial throughout science, but what is deemed responsible is fluid and pluralistic. Moreover, the evaluation of you as a researcher is after the fact (i.e., retrospective), while you have to make decisions prior to the fact (i.e., prospective). This causes an inherent asymmetry in the evaluation of your research conduct, presenting itself in the form of hindsight bias. How can you be confident in your prospective decision making if the evaluation of it is dependent on the consequences? Inertia is not an option, so we need something to guide us. In this talk, I extend on a normative framework for responsible conduct of research to guide you in prospective decision making and provide some practical recommendations to embody it in your work.
